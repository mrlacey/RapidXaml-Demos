# RXD001

This is just a sample Analyzer error that exists for testing and demonstration purposes only.

It means that you have a control called `MyUserControl` in your XAML that does not have a `Name` attribute. If you set this property the warning will go away.

You can [create your own XAML analyzers](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/blob/master/docs/custom-analysis.md).
